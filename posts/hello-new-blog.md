After returning to Canada on November 11, 2026, and coming back to Waterloo a week later, I’ve found myself in a strange state. Over the past two weeks, I haven’t applied for any jobs, even though I’m constantly worried about my financial situation. I keep telling myself that I need time to study, but in reality I’ve spent very little time actually learning. I know I’m avoiding the pressure, but I simply don’t have the courage to break out of this cycle yet.

The old blog based on WordPress, which is built a long time age but never got used, is also gone when I deleted the old server.

Recently, I bought a new VPS and set up a fresh system. I also moved my personal website, gongjian.me, onto it. The old WordPress blog, which I built a long time ago but never really used, disappeared when I deleted the previous server. With this new setup, I deployed a modern Astro-based blog and decided to restart my English writing practice here.
