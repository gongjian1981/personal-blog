After turning back to Canada in 11th Nov 2026, and back to Waterloo in 18th Nov 2026, I find myself in a werid status. In these two weeks, I didn't apply for any jobs while I'm anxious about my finicial status. I use learning as an excuse but spent a litter time in studying. I know I'm avoiding pressure, but I don't have the courage to change this.

After buy a new VPS and deploy a new system. I also transfer my personal website *gongjian.me* to this server. The old blog based on WordPress, which is built a long time age but never got used, is also gone when I deleted the old server. With a new server, I deployed a new blog system using a more modern system Astro, and decide to restart practise my English writing by writing blog.

I'll write in my own words first, and then using AI to tell me how to improve.

So let's start!
